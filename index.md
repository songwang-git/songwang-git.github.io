## Welcome to My Pages

I am interested in developing something interesting.

### Deep Reinforcement Learning with Surrogate Agent-Environment Interface

In this paper we propose surrogate agent-environment interface (SAEI) in reinforcement learning. We also state that learning based on probability surrogate agent-environment interface gives optimal policy of task agent-environment interface. We introduce surrogate probability action and develope the probability surrogate action deterministic policy gradient (PSADPG) algorithm based on SAEI. This algorithm enables continuous control of discrete action. The experiments show PSADPG achieves the performance of DQN in the long run for selected tasks.

### Kaggle Competition “Helping Santa's Helpers”

I was competing in the Kaggle data science competetion. This 'Santa' is more about optimization and algorithm development. In my solutions, the best result is given by Solution 2 which gives the ranked 49 result. However, with minor change it will give a better result with a bug which can make it ranked around 38. The bug is that it will generate 10000001 assignments other than 10000000. Solution opt is the first step to the optimization. ([See code](https://github.com/songwang-git/Santa))
